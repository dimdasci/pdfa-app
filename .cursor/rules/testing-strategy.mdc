# Testing Strategy

For the MVP phase, maintain a pragmatic approach to testing that ensures reliability without slowing development:

## Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Focus on testing complex business logic
   - Test utility functions thoroughly
   - Use Jest and React Testing Library

2. **Component Tests**
   - Test key UI components in isolation
   - Verify component behavior, not implementation details
   - Use React Testing Library's user-event for interaction testing

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test critical user flows
   - Focus on high-value features first
   - Verify that components work together correctly

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for complex logic and critical paths
- Skip tests for simple UI components in early stages
- Prioritize test coverage for:
  - PDF processing logic
  - Layer manipulation functionality
  - Error handling

## Testing Balance

As an MVP, follow the testing pyramid with emphasis on:
- Many unit tests for core PDF processing logic
- Moderate component tests for key interactive elements
- Few integration tests covering critical flows
