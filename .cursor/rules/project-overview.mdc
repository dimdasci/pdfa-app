# PDF Structure Analysis Tool Overview

The PDF Structure Analysis Tool is an MVP React web application that gives engineers visual insight into PDF internals to debug extraction errors. The main features include:

- Layer slicer & outliner for different PDF element types (text/path/image/etc.)
- Interactive layer toggles in the browser
- Object-level metadata export
- Client-side anomaly detection (zero-area, repeated patterns)

## Project Context

This project is part of a larger ecosystem of applications under dimosaic.dev. It specifically lives at the subdomain pdfa.dimosaic.dev. The authentication is centrally managed at the dimosaic.dev level, with this application consuming the shared authentication.
