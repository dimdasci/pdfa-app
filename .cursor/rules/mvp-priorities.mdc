# MVP Development Priorities

Follow these priorities to ensure we deliver a valuable MVP that balances simplicity and quality:

## Priority Features (Must Have)

1. **Layer Slicer & Outliner** (M01)
   - Extract and display text, path, and image layers
   - Provide visual outlines for PDF objects
   - Implement z-index based layer organization

2. **Interactive Layer Controls** (M02)
   - Toggle visibility of different object types
   - Toggle outlines independently from content
   - Display object statistics for each layer

## Secondary Features (Should Have)

1. **Zero-Area Object Detection** (S01)
   - Client-side detection of objects with zero or near-zero dimensions
   - Visual highlighting of problematic objects

2. **Repeated Pattern Detection** (S02)
   - Identify elements that repeat across pages (headers/footers)
   - Provide categorization of repeated elements

## Development Approach

- **Start Small**: Begin with core document viewing capability
- **Incremental Delivery**: Add features one by one following [plan.md](mdc:docs/plan.md)
- **Regular Demos**: Demonstrate progress after completing each step
- **Technical Focus**: Prioritize UI and processing quality over comprehensive feature set
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest implementation that meets requirements
- **User Validation**: Schedule user testing after key milestones
